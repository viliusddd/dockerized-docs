Fancy a spot of offline tinkering, old chap? This jolly little contraption lets you peruse open-source documentation without so much as a whiff of Wi-Fi. Perfect for those dreary train rides or when the Internet decides to take a tea break. It's like carrying the wisdom of the web in your waistcoat pocket—pip-pip, cheerio, and happy coding!

# Requirements
- Docker, optionally Docker Desktop

# Basic Usage
To start the servers, comment out the containers you don’t want to run in `compose.yml`, then execute:
```sh
docker compose up
```

Access the documentation by opening Chrome and navigating to, for example: `localhost:3012`
